# [Issue Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker)

This project is the second of five projects completed for FreeCodeCamp's sixth (final JavaScript) certificate: [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/#advanced-node-and-express). The Issue Tracker's [assignment instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/issue-tracker) and [starter code on GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-issuetracker/) were provided by FreeCodeCamp. A live demo of the project can be found on [Replit](https://replit.com/@john-albright/issue-tracker-free-code-camp).

The application was created with Express.js (a Node.js framework) to track issues encountered during the creation of a project. GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests can be made to the route /api/issues/apitest, three of which can be made using the forms found on the root route and in the index.html file in the views folder.

Fourteen tests were written for the project using Chai.js.
